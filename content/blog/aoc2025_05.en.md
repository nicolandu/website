[Today's Advent of Code challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/5) involved calculating the union of massive ranges.

<!-- Talk about reflection process -->

Eventually, after [a quick search on crates.io](https://crates.io/search?q=range%20union), I found a neat little crate, [`range_union_find`](https://docs.rs/range_union_find/), that could allow me to not have to reinvent the wheel. "Implementing" an efficient strategy was as simple as this:
```bash
cargo add range_union_find
```
```rust
use range_union_find::RangeUnionFind;
```

I *knew* that a `Vec` with all elements really wouldn't cut it (who has enough memory for 2<sup>50</sup> entries?), and getting any ad-hoc implementation to work right was guaranteed to be massive a pain in the neck. I did what came to my mind: it wasn't a matter of pride, it was a matter of efficiency.

Moral of the story: work smarter, not harder.
